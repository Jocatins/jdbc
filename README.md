## JDBC Connection Setup Guide

Load the JDBC Driver: Load the JDBC driver for the database you are connecting to. The driver is usually provided by the database vendor and can be found in a JAR file.

Register the Driver: Register the JDBC driver with the DriverManager class. This step is necessary to inform the DriverManager about the driver class that will be used to establish the connection.

Establish Connection: Use the DriverManager.getConnection() method to establish a connection to the database. Pass the URL of the database, username, and password as parameters to this method.

Create a Statement: Once the connection is established, create a Statement object using the Connection.createStatement() method. This statement object will be used to execute SQL queries against the database.

Execute SQL Queries: Use the Statement object to execute SQL queries such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc.

Process Results: If the SQL query returns a ResultSet (e.g., SELECT query), use methods such as ResultSet.next() and ResultSet.getString() to process the results.

Close Resources: After executing all necessary SQL queries and processing the results, close the ResultSet, Statement, and Connection objects to release database resources and prevent memory leaks.
